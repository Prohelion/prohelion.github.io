Splunk is a commercial product and typically requires a commercial license for larger data sets. TeamArrow applies for the [Splunk 4 Good program](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/about-us/splunk4good.html), which provides free Splunk licenses to organisations that are seeing to do non commercial based activities.
