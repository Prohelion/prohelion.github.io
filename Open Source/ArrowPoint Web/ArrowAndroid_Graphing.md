The graphing dashboard allows you to do basic graphing of key attributes on the tablet, this is generally useful when team members want to know something but donâ€™t want to be bothering the strategy or telemetry teams.

Because the ArrowPoint Telemetry application is written to be mobile friendly, if a team member needs more information they can also use their phone or tablet to log in to the [Telemetry Reporting](ArrowTelemetry_Reporting.html) or use the [Integration with Splunk](ArrowTelemetry_Splunk.html) to do more complex reporting.
