The telemetry system allows you to do basic reporting by selecting the device that you want to report on off the menu

{% include image.html file="telemetry_reporting.png" alt="telemetry_reporting" caption="Example of the Telemetry Reporting" %}

Note that for more advanced reporting we would suggest using the [Integration with Splunk](ArrowTelemetry_Splunk.html) which allows you to do very complex and rich reporting.
