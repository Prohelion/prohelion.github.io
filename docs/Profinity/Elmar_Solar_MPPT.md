# Elmar Solar MPPT

Elmar Solar produces some of the worlds most efficient Peak Power Trackers (MPPT).  These trackers are used to optimize the power output of Solar Arrays.  You can purchase Elmar Solar MPPT devices through the [Prohelion](https://www.prohelion.com) website.

You can manage an Elmar Solar MPPT using Profinity by adding a new Elmar Solar MPPT tracker to your [Profile](Profiles.md). Once the MPPT has been added to your profile, the Elmar Solar MPPT dashboard will be available in the sidebar.
