# Reading Data

Once all of your components have been configured, you are ready to start receiving and reading data.

Each component in your system will have an associated dashboard which can be accessed by selecting the component from the sidebar. The component dashboards are tailored to the specific component and display all of the relevant information and data for that component in a convenient fashion.
