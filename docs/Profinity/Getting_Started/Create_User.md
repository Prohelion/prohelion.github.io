# Creating a User

After installing Profinity V2 it is recommended to create a new user to suit your use case. To create a new user, select the `ADMIN` tab, then `Users` and `+ ADD USER`. Here you are able to define a new user and their associated login details.

Each user can also be granted different security roles, either allowing or restricting the different Profinity functionality that the particular user has access to. Giving a user the administrator role automatically grants the privileges of all other roles.

For example, it may be beneficial to create an 'Observer' user without edit access to allow viewing of system information without risk of accidentally changing any parameters.
