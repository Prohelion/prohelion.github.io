# Profinity Scripting

Welcome to the Profinity Scripting documentation. This section provides comprehensive information about scripting in Profinity, including supported languages, script types, and available operations.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Profinity scripting, here is a few things to know before you get started.

## Script Types

Profinity supports three types of scripts, each designed for specific use cases:

- [Run Scripts](./ScriptTypes.md#run-scripts): For manual or scheduled operations
- [Receive Scripts](./ScriptTypes.md#receive-scripts): For handling incoming CAN messages
- [Service Scripts](./ScriptTypes.md#service-scripts): For continuous, long-running operations

Learn more about script types in our [Script Types](./ScriptTypes.md) documentation.

## Supported Languages

Profinity scripting supports three programming languages, you can code in any of these supported languages:

- C#: For complex, type-safe operations
- JavaScript: For quick scripting and prototyping
- Python: For data processing and analysis

Each language has its strengths and ideal use cases. See the [Supported Languages](./SupportedLanguages.md) documentation for detailed comparisons.

## Operations

Profinity provides various out of the box operations to support your script development:

- [CANBus](./Operations/CANBus.md): For CAN communication
- [DBC](./Operations/DBC.md): For DBC Message and Signal handling
- [State](./Operations/State.md): For data persistence
- [Console](./Operations/Console.md): For output and logging
