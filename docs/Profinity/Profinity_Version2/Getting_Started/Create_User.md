# Creating a User

After installing Profinity it is recommended to create a new user to suit your use case. To create a new user, select the `ADMIN` tab, then `Users` and `+ ADD USER`. Here you are able to define a new user and their associated login details.

Each user can also be granted different security roles, either allowing or restricting certain Profinity functionality for that particular user. Giving a user the administrator role automatically grants the privileges of all other roles.

# More Information

Addition information on how to create and manage users can be found in the [Admin / Manage Users](../Admin/manage_users.md) section of this documentation.
