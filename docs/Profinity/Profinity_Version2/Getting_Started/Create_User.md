# Creating a User

After installing Profinity it is recommended to create a new user to suit your use case. To create a new user, select the `ADMIN` tab, then `Users` and `+ ADD USER`. Here you are able to define a new user and their associated login details.

Each user can also be granted different security roles, either allowing or restricting certain Profinity functionality for that particular user. Giving a user the administrator role automatically grants the privileges of all other roles.

For example, it may be beneficial to create an 'Observer' user without edit access to allow viewing of system information without risk of accidentally changing any parameters.
