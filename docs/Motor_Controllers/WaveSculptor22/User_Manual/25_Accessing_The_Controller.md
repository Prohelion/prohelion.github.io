# Accessing the Controller

## Safety

Opening the cover on the WaveSculptor will expose the high power terminals for battery and motor phase connections.  High voltages may be present inside this cover.  Before opening, make sure that the battery contactors are dis-engaged, so that high voltage is not present at the motor controller.  Allow one minute for the internal capacitors to discharge before working on the controller.

## Inspection Cover

The lid of the controller is held closed against the base with stainless steel M3 button hex head screws, two at each end of the controller.  Use a 2mm allen (hex) key to loosen and remove all four screws.

Lift off the lid and set it aside.  Use a multimeter to check across the battery connection terminals for high voltage.  If more than a few volts are present, wait additional time for the capacitors to discharge to a safe level. 

To avoid damage due to static discharge, touch the controller body before working inside the controller and touching any internal circuit boards.

Be extremely careful to not drop loose fasteners into the motor controller, as they may move around while driving and short out the battery or motor phase connections.  

When finished working inside the WaveSculptor, replace the lid and insert and tighten all four screws.
