# Driving 

## Warnings

Perform the following tests in a location off public roads, in an area free of obstructions.  Take all appropriate safety precautions when performing this testing.

Using the Windows configuration software, set the vehicle mass to the actual mass of the vehicle, so that the velocity control loop will be tuned optimally.

## Procedure

Perform the same checks that were performed with the vehicle off the ground:

- [ ] Driving forwards
- [ ] Car coasts to a stop when accelerator pedal is lifted
- [ ] Driving in reverse
- [ ] Car coasts to a stop when accelerator pedal is lifted
- [ ] Appropriate action happens when brake pedal is pushed
- [ ] If your driver controls is configured to use regen, it works correctly in forwards
- [ ] If your driver controls is configured to use regen, it works correctly in reverse
- [ ] Selecting Neutral on the driver controls makes the car coast to a stop
- [ ] Turning off the key makes the car coast to a stop

## On Road testing

After meeting all the relevant regulations in your country for vehicle registration and safety checks, you should be ready to drive your car out in the real world!  We suggest gradually building up your confidence in the new drive system with a series of tests, at increasing speeds and power levels.
