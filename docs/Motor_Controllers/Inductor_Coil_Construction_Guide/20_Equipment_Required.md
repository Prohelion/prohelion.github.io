# Equiptment Required

*   Solder pot: Required to strip insulation from ends of litz wire.

*   Fume hood and personal protective equipment to use with solder pot: Wire insulation fumes can be toxic, depending on the insulation material.  

*   Vacuum chamber: Recommended to use when applying transformer varnish or epoxy coating to inductors, to remove trapped air bubbles.  It is  possible to perform this step without pulling a vacuum on the inductors, but much better results will be achieved with it.

*   Crimp tool: Required to crimp the PP75 connectors or M6 bolt lugs onto the ends of the wire after soldering.

*   Gas torch: Required to reflow the solder into the PP75 crimps or bolt lugs after crimping.  This step may be possible with a high-powered hot air gun (paint stripper), but a gas torch will be guaranteed to work properly.
