# Contactor Selection

The three contactors used to break the HV DC connections must be appropriately rated for the currents and voltages seen during both normal use and during fault situations.  Typical parts used in automotive sized packs are the Tyco EV200 or the <strong>Gigavac GX11</strong> or <strong>GX12 series</strong>.  Selection of these parts is beyond the scope of this document.
