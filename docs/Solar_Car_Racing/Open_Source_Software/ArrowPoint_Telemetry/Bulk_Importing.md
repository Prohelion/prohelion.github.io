title: Bulk Importing
---

The system provides the ability for CAN Bus files that have been recorded by either [Profinity](../../../Profinity_Software/index.md) the [ArrowPoint CAN Bus Tools](../ArrowPoint_CANBus_Tools/index.md) or the Tritium Can Logger to be bulk loaded in to the telemetry system.

This is particularly useful if you want to analyse previously recorded CAN Bus files in the reporting tools such as Splunk.  An example canlog.csv file can be found in the root directory of the source code for the Telemetry system.

To load a file place it in the 

```
[Install Dir]/CAN Bus_bulkloaddirectory.
```
