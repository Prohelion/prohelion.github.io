title: ArrowPoint CAN bus Tools
---

ArrowPoint CAN bus Tools is a Windows based platform designed to receive and display telemetry information from an WiFi access point in real time.  Its functionality has been replaced by Prohelion's [Profinity](../../../Profinity_Software/index.md) tools, so we are providing it to the community as an Open Source solution to help you learn more about CAN Bus development and approaches.

The out of the box implementation is designed for use in Solar or Electric racing cars that use technology from [Prohelion](https://www.prohelion.com/) or [Tritium](https://www.tritiumcharging.com/). This solution was originally developed by [TeamArrow](https://www.teamarrow.com.au/) and has been used in racing environments since 2015.

If you are interested in contributing to the solution, please see our [Contribution File](https://github.com/Prohelion/ArrowPoint-CANbus-Tools/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) 

The application provides

* The ability to view and transmit CAN Bus packets
* The ability to log CAN Bus packets and replay them
* Simulate a driver controller
* Simulate a motor controller

The application is compatible with

* Prohelion Battery Packs
* Prohelion and Tritium Driver Controllers
* Prohelion and Tritium WaveSculptors
* Prohelion and Tritium BMUs and CMUs

The Wifi connection should be broadcasting CAN Bus data using the Tritium CAN Bus identifiers.
