# Prohelion BMS D1000 Gen2

The Prohelion BMS D1000 Gen2 is a cutting-edge, distributed Battery Management System designed for high-voltage applications. It provides comprehensive monitoring and protection for battery packs up to 1000V, accommodating up to 448 individual cells with precise voltage management through its advanced architecture. The system leverages a Battery Junction Unit (BJU) and multiple Cell Monitoring Units (CMUs), each capable of handling 14 cells, to ensure optimal performance, safety, and longevity of your energy storage solutions. Whether for industrial, automotive, or energy applications, the Prohelion BMS D1000 Gen2 offers unparalleled reliability and scalability.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture of the Prohelion BMS D1000 Gen2 is built around a distributed approach, where the Prohelion D1000 Gen2 Battery Management Unit (BMU) serves as the central hub, managing communication and coordination across the system. Each battery pack is monitored by several Prohelion D1000 Gen2 Cell Monitoring Units (CMUs), with each CMU capable of monitoring 14 individual cell voltages. This modular setup allows for scalability, enabling the system to manage up to 448 cells across a battery pack. The BMU interfaces with the CMUs, collecting data on cell voltages, temperatures, and overall pack health, while also controlling contractors and other safety mechanisms to protect against overvoltage, undervoltage, and thermal issues. The distributed nature of the system reduces wiring complexity and enhances fault tolerance, making it highly reliable for high-voltage applications.

## Safety 

!!! caution "Caution"
    The following safety precautions must be observed during all phases of operation, service and repair of this equipment. Failure to comply with the safety precautions or warnings in this document violates safety standards of design, manufacture and intended use of this equipment and may impair the built-in protections. Prohelion shall not be liable for userâ€™s failure to comply with these requirements

!!! warning "Danger - DC Voltage"
    This System controls DC voltages (~48VDC) with the potential to deliver high current (>200A), failure to isolate and test for isolation before installation, service or troubleshooting could result in damage to equipment or personal! 

!!! warning "Danger - Live Circuits"
    Operating personnel should not remove the unit covers. No internal adjustment or component replacement is allowed by non Prohelion qualified personnel (excluding fuses). Never replace components with the power cable connected. To avoid injuries, always disconnect power, remove external voltage sources, discharge circuits and test for dangerous voltage potentials before touching components.
