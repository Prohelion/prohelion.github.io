# Battery Management System User Manual

This document describes the interface, installation, and usage requirements for the Prohelion Battery Management System (BMS).   

The BMS provides an easy way to monitor and control an Electric Vehicle battery pack, and can work seamlessly with Prohelion's WaveSculptor motor controllers.  It is a mature design with five previous product generations of real-world experience with various types of cells, form factors, and vehicles.

The BMS consists of two components: multiple [Cell Management Units](../Cell_Management_Unit/index.md) (CMU), which measure and control the individual cells in the battery pack; and a single [BMS Master Unit](50_BMS_Master_Unit.md) (BMU) which interfaces between the CMUs and the vehicle, controls precharge and other safety systems, and provides total pack telemetry.
