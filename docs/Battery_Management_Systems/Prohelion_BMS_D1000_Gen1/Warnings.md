# Warnings

A properly designed BMS system will protect a battery pack from being operated outside of acceptable limits.  However, a poorly implemented system may not provide the expected protection â€“ the Prohelion BMS must be installed in a professional and competent manner to function as designed. 

Attention should also be paid to the larger system that the vehicle is part of, especially the systems associated with charging and the infrastructure to support it.  As well as using the BMS to protect the pack, additional systems should be provided as backup as part of the charging infrastructure, for instance: fitting of smoke detectors; overcurrent and RCD protection in the AC supply; regular physical checks of charge cabling and connections; regular review of telemetry data for abnormal readings.   

This list is not exhaustive, and it is the responsibility of the system designer / installer to conduct their own failure mode analysis and determine what is required. 

!!! danger "Working Around Batteries is DANGEROUS"
    Not only are lethal high voltages present, but individual cells can also put out thousands of amps when shorted, for example with a stray wire or dropped tool, throwing out arcs and molten metal. 

!!! danger "Ensure Your Pack Is Correctly Fused"
    The battery pack must be fused in each physical pack section with a fuse rated for at least the full DC pack voltage.  Note that it must be a DC rated fuse. 
    
    Selection of fuse type and current rating is beyond the scope of this document, as it depends on expected load profile and duration, cable sizing and temperature rating, cable installation methods, and short-circuit rating of the pack, among other factors. 

Check the legal requirements in your jurisdiction for using licensed technicians for this type of work. 

!!! tip "Stay Safe"
    - Wear eye protection.  
    - Use insulated tools.  
    - Take extreme caution.
    - Go slow. 

Think through every step before doing it.
