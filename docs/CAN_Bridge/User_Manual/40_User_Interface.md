# User Interface

The CANâ€“Ethernet bridge user interface consists of a single push-button and green LED in the front decal.  

Holding down the button for more than 5 seconds when the bridge is running will reset the bridge configuration back to factory default settings, and this event is shown by illuminating the front-panel LED briefly.

Holding down the button for at least 5 seconds while powering up the bridge will run the bootloader, allowing the bridge firmware to be updated.
