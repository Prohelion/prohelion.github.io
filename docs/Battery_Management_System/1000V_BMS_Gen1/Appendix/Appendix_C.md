# Guide to Successful Crimping 

## Molex MicroFit 3.0

A dedicated MicroFit hand tool such as Molex part number __63819-0000__ is the correct tool for the job.  This tool is available from Digikey, part __WM9022-ND__.  This tool provides far superior results compared to the generic crimp tool and will result in the most reliable and safe installation.

At the bare minimum, use a quality hand crimp tool such as Molex part number __0638111000__, available at a reasonable price from Digikey, part __WM9999-ND__.  The tool must be shaped to fold the crimp ears around and down through the centre of the wire conductor bundle – crimping with pliers or an 'automotive' barrel type crimp tool will not give a satisfactory result.  

Refer to the Molex [Quality Crimping Handbook](https://tools.molex.com/pdm_docs/ats/TM-638000029.pdf)

Note the pictures in the “Troubleshooting” section for the visual differences between a good and a bad crimp.
