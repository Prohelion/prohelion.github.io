# Contactor Selection

The three contactors used to break the HV DC connections must be appropriately rated for the currents and voltages seen during both normal use and during fault situations.  Typical parts used in automotive sized packs are the Tyco EV200 or the __Gigavac GX11__ or __GX12 series__.  Selection of these parts is beyond the scope of this document.
