# Fusing 

The battery pack must be fused in each physical pack section with a fuse rated for at least the full DC pack voltage.  Note that it must be a DC rated fuse. 

Selection of fuse type and current rating is beyond the scope of this document, as it depends on expected load profile and duration, cable sizing and temperature rating, cable installation methods, and short-circuit rating of the pack, among other factors.
