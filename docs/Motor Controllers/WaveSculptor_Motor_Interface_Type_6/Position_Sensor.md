# Position Sensor

## Type

The type 6 interface reads three channels of position information from a <strong>quadrature encoder position sensor</strong> with <strong>single-ended outputs. </strong> It provides each channel with a 10k pull-up resistor for use with open-collector sensors.

## Power 

Power is provided to the sensors, and this voltage is also used as the pull-up voltage for the three input resistors.  By default, the voltage provided is 12V DC, but this can also be chosen as a factory option to be 5V DC.  

## Inputs

Each input is sensed by a schmitt-trigger logic input with hysteresis.  Rising and falling input thresholds are at 2/3 and 1/3 of the power supply voltage.

## Connector

The connector used for the motor sense signals is a 6-way 3mm pitch Molex MicroFit connector.  The pinout is shown below, as viewed from the wire side â€“ as you would look at it while inserting crimps.
