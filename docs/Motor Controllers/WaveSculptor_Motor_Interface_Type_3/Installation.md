# Installation

## Position

To minimise the length that low-powered signals from the position and temperature sensors have to travel, install the interface board as close to the motor as possible, usually inside the motor terminal box.  Insulate it with heatshrink or similar if necessary.

## Wiring

Wire a straight-through cable from the WaveSculptor to the motor interface board 14-pin connectors, using the twisted-pair cable recommended in the previous section.

Wire the position sensor to the 8-way connector.

Wire the temperature sensors to the 4-way connector.
