    text: Prohelion’s CAN-Ethernet bridge makes it easy to form a virtual link between physically separated CAN networks. The CAN/Ethernet network arrangement is extremely flexible – you can connect the bridge point to point, over a local network or even via the internet using a Virtual Private Network (VPN). The CAN-Ethernet bridge is compatible with all Prohelion products. (todo)
