## Reporting

The telemetry system allows you to do basic reporting by selecting the device that you want to report on off the menu

![Example of the Telemetry Reporting](images/telemetry_reporting.png)

Note that for more advanced reporting we would suggest using the [Integration with Splunk](Splunk.md) which allows you to do very complex and rich reporting.
