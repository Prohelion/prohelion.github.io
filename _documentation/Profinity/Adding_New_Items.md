# Adding new items to your Profile

Items can be added to your profile by right mouse clicking on the profile and selecting 'Add / New Item', at which point a panel is shown with all of the available items that can be added.

Adding a new item is as simple as selecting what you want to add to your profile, changing the properties to whatever you require and then pressing the add button.  

If the profile already has an item with the same name as what you are proposing, then a digit will be added to the item name to keep the profile item names unique.

You can add multiple items of the same type to your profile, but they must have unique names and the base address of the item is also generally unique.
