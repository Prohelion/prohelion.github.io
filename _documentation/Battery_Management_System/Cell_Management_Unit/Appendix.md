# Appendix B: Guide to Successful crimping 

## Molex MicroFit 3.0

A dedicated MicroFit hand tool such as Molex part number <strong>63819-0000</strong> is the correct tool for the job.  This tool is available from Digikey, part <strong>WM9022-ND</strong>.  This tool provides far superior results compared to the generic crimp tool and will result in the most reliable and safe installation.

At the bare minimum, use a quality hand crimp tool such as Molex part number <strong>0638111000</strong>, available at a reasonable price from Digikey, part <strong>WM9999-ND</strong>.  The tool must be shaped to fold the crimp ears around and down through the centre of the wire conductor bundle – crimping with pliers or an 'automotive' barrel type crimp tool will not give a satisfactory result.  

Refer to the Molex [Quality Crimping Handbook](http://www.molex.com/pdm_docs/ats/TM-638000029.pdf)

Note the pictures in the “Troubleshooting” section for the visual differences between a good and a bad crimp.
