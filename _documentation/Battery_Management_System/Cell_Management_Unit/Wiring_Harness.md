# Wiring Harness

The cell voltage sense harness should be wired with cable rugged enough to tolerate some abrasion due to vibration in the battery pack, with a voltage rating of several hundred volts (in case it touches a cell further along the series string) and with a resistance such that the balance current won't cause significant changes in the cell voltage reading.  It should be small enough diameter to fit into the microfit housing and crimps, but not too small to crimp into the ring terminals that connect to the cell.  

Prohelion has identified a suitable cable as part from Pro Power, part number <strong>05B91510</strong>.  This is the cable used in the pictures for the next section of this document.

The ring terminals used to connect to the cell should be suitable for the cable chosen.  Doubling the stripped cable over may bring it up to a suitable size for a wider selection of terminals.
