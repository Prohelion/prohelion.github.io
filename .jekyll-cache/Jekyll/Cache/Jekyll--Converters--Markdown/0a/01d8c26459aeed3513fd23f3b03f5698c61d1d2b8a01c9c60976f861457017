<p>The ArrowPoint for Android Solution is an Android App designed to receive and display telemetry information from an WiFi access point in real time. It is a very useful tool in a race environment as every team member can have a copy installed on their own phone or tablet and get instant insights in to the performance of the vehicle.</p>

<p>The out of the box implementation is designed for use in Solar or Electric racing cars that use technology from <a href="https://www.prohelion.com">Prohelion</a> or <a href="https://www.tritium.com.au">Tritium</a>. This solution was originally developed by <a href="https://www.teamarrow.com.au/">TeamArrow</a> and has been used in racing environments since 2015. <a href="https://www.teamarrow.com.au/">TeamArrow</a> continue to use this application both as the in car dashboard as well as a solution for the entire fleet to communicate and monitor the car.</p>
