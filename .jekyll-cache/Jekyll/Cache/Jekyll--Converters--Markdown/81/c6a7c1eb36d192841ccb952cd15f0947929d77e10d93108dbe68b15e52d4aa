<p>Compiling the solution requires Visual Studio 2017 with the C# modules installed. The community edition of Visual Studio works fine for building this code.</p>

<p>You have two options to build the code, either load the project in Visual Studio 2017 and build normally or execute a build on the command line by opening the Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio 2017 and then running</p>

<p>in the root level source code directory. Information on running msbuild can be found on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?redirectedfrom=MSDN&amp;view=vs-2019">Microsoft Visual Studio Website</a>.</p>
