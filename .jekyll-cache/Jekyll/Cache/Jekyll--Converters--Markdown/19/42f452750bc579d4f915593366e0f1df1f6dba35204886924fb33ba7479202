<p>The graphing dashboard allows you to do basic graphing of key attributes on the tablet, this is generally useful when team members want to know something but donâ€™t want to be bothering the strategy or telemetry teams.</p>

<p>Because the ArrowPoint Telemetry application is written to be mobile friendly, if a team member needs more information they can also use their phone or tablet to log in to the <a href="../ArrowPoint_Telemetry/Reporting.html">Telemetry Reporting</a> or use the <a href="../ArrowPoint_Telemetry/Splunk.html">Integration with Splunk</a> to do more complex reporting.</p>
