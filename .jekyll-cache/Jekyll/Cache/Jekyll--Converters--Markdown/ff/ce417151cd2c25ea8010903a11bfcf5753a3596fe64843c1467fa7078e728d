<p>The solar energy dashboard show the current performance of the solar array as well as the net power position to the battery.</p>

<p>In the example below the array is currently generating almost no power as there is a Total Input (W) of 1.56w (probably not a great example sorry!) and the controller is consuming 2673w, hence the current net power position on the car is -2672w.</p>
